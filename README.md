# yoga-sadhana-tracker
A sacred practice tracker for Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya and Isha Kriya with mandala visualization, honoring the ancient spiritual traditions of a certain gruru who went up to Chamundi Hill after falling out of Love. 
This Guru parked his motorcycle and sat on an outcrop of rock about two-thirds of the way up Chamunid Hill. 
This outcrop had been the Guru's "contemplation rock."
It was said a Purple Berry tree and a stunted banyan had put down tenacious roots into a deep fissure in the rock's surface. 
Nonetheless, it was then, that he, the Guru watched a panoramic view of the city, unfold before him. 

You can be relieved of your duty, ya know. 
We got you.
