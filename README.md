# yoga-sadhana-tracker
A sacred practice tracker for Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya and Isha Kriya with mandala visualization, honoring the ancient spiritual traditions of a certain Guru who went up to Chamundi Hill after falling out of love.
This Guru parked his motorcycle and sat on an outcrop of rock about two-thirds of the way up the hill - his "contemplation rock." A purple berry tree and a stunted banyan had put down tenacious roots into a deep fissure in the rock's surface. It was there, in that moment, that the Guru watched a panoramic view of the city unfold before him - and everything for him changed.
